  # NYC Citi Bike Analysis
    
  This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data. The Tableau story also covers teh case study which throws light on how the BikeShare Program will fare in Des Moines.
    
 ## Question
   
 What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
